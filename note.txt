This application is short simple,
Built on angular 7

To run the application:
1. Intsall node 8 + (or from stable version) https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install angular cli ( npm install -g @angular/cli )
3. clone repo 
4. cd url-shortner-app
5. run npm install to then ng serve
6. to test in a separate termial but same directory run ng test

The application has two functions
1. fetchUrl: which gets the catured long url form the template (form) and initiates a request to generate shortened url as a
   5 string random string.(For perfomance instead of fetching resultdirectly from the db, we can implement a cache memory to check if url is available there 
   , if not load data from the db)
2. generateShortUrl: which generates the 5 random strings value and appends it to the host url whose value is presentd to the user
       as the shortned url
       

When the shortened url is clicked the user is redirected to the long url on the same browser screen



To make or improve this application for scalability:
1. I Would have created a backend api which generates a randoms 5 - 8 string, get the long url and store this to values(encoded) in a db with coloums (long-url and short-url)
   then retun this values (decoded) as part of the response i.e
   {longUrl: https://dev.to/avatsaev/simple-state-management-in-angular-with-only-services-and-rxjs-41p8,
    shorrUrl: (nameofmyapplication_host)/1JHA2
    }
    
 2. Implemeted a frontend where i can capture the long url then return the shortned version with  a redirct function when clicked
 3. Deploy both version to some secure url and open it up to the public
